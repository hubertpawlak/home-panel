# What is Home Panel?
Home Panel is a secure control panel accessible anywhere. Currently available only in Polish. It started as a simple local temperature monitoring system. The end goal is to expand it into a complete solution to manage things at my home such as motors, thermostats and pumps based on manual input or data gathered from sensors. It would be great to automatically open blindfolds, water my plants or simply get notified when something goes wrong without my interaction. There are existing solutions to these problems but I wanted to improve both my programming and tinkering skills.

Home Panel is designed to be hosted in the cloud. It depends on the following services:
- Vercel
- Supertokens (for GitHub and Google OAuth, can be self-hosted)
- Supabase (for PostgreSQL, can be self-hosted)
- Upstash (serverless Redis, used for rate-limiting and dynamic configuration)
- Logtail (for finding rare bugs)

You probably can run it locally but it's not officially supported.

# Supported sources
- Temperature sensors
- Uninterruptible power supplies

I recommend using [universal-data-source](https://github.com/hubertpawlak/universal-data-source) as it is designed to work with Home Panel out of the box.
